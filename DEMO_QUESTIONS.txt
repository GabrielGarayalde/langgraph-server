------------------------------
(FORMULA SEARCH) can you give me the reference buckling moment formula?
----------------------------
(TABLE SEARCH W VISION) can you give me table for all the combination factors for actions?
--------------------------
(FIGURE ANALYSIS W VISION) for a one way spanning concrete slab can you tell me how far over the support the bottom reinforcement needs to extend?
--------------------
(TABLE SEARCH) search the database for universal beams dimensions and properties, then get the S and Z for a 200uB29.8 from that page. also check this document for whether its a compact section and its yield stress fy.

(DB SEARCH) now search the database for information on the moment bending capacity of a compact section and calculate it.

(EXCEL CALCULATION) can you calculate the moment capacity ? also lets calculate the design bending moment and stress for a 6m simply supported beam with a 25kn/m distributed load. use the excel spreadsheet.

-----------------------------
(DB FORMULA SEARCH) search for the design bending moment formula of a timber beam

(EXCEL SEARCH) Lets search to see if there are any excel sheets that we can use that perform this formula calculation. note the required input values

(DB TABLE SEARCH) Lets find the values before executing the design bending capacity formula excel. for now lets get the capacity factor and the k1 duration factor. its a primary member in a house and the load duration is long (permanent).

(FINAL EXCEL CALC) k4 to k12 are all 1. find the fb' from the appendix in the timber code for an F17 hardwood. and then calculate the Z based on a 50 wide 100 deep beam. then put this all into the excel.
